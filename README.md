// TODO:
- figure out why the 3 album components on the right will re-render the 1st time i click either an arrow button or menu photo, & only the 1st time
- figure out how to get album name text to be bright while background img is dimmer -> look at what TripAdvisor did: gray overlay on background img, then text span on top

- refactor assignFilters in generatePhotoInfo in seedHelpers.js to be more accurate to real life, e.g. follow actual categories/types of the photos rather than random?
- fill out trips for generatePhotoInfo based on actual trips user creates w/ UI
- refactor user contributions in generateUserInfo to count actual # of contributions per user?
- refactor Carousel & PhotoMenu into class components, move props unique to those from App.jsx
